- First of all: **YMDK** has an existing 10-layer **Vial** firmware available for their ID75 keyboard, (but with only 15 Macros, and too many unused layers that taking up the EEPROM space on the chip).
  You may just ask **YMDK** to email a copy to you and skip the needs to compile the firmware yourself.
-
- This code was original from **YMDK** service representative, with minor configuration fix and added required files to to port it to be **vial-qmk** ready.
- **YMDK** service representative refused to upload the source code to **qmk** GIT hub nor did they wanted to show how to setup and compile the vial firmware to the **uf2** format for their id75 keyboard, which make is a huge barriers for inexperience users to make modification on this keyboard. 
  
  The **misconduct** of **YMDK** failed to release the **full** source code of the distributed vial-qmk firmware for **id75** is against the **Copyright laws.**
- Because the **qmk framework** is released under **GPL v2 license**, which requires all vendors who uses the **qmk** firmware **MUST** release the source code with the binaries in their products.
-
- This firmware is both **via** and **vial** compatible, you may use either configurator tool to configure the keyboard.  But the **vial** is noticeably better and provides a whole lot extra features, like tap dance, combos, key override, etc.
-
- **WARNING**:  This code is for for **Idobao/YMDK** version of **id75** keyboard which runs on the **STM32F103C8T6** chip/MCU (a.k.a. the **Blue pills**).  It is not compatible with the **Idobao's** other id75 keyboard which might use other chip/MCU, e.g. : **ATmega32**
-
- **WARNING**: the code is compliable and lightly tested working. you might need fix any issue you may encounter.
- Rarely, you may see error when use this firmware with the **vial** configurator tool, but it won't affect the usage of the keyboard in any ways. You may dismiss the error by just close (kill) and reopen the **vial** configurator tool.
-
- You need a working environment to be able to compile the code, for Windows, it is **MSYS**.
  Follow the steps in below location to setup your **Vial-Qmk** environment:
  https://get.vial.today/docs/porting-to-vial.html
- (you may need to follow the link inside above link if you also need to set up the **QMK** development environment, **MSYS**)
-
- Steps to to pull and compile the source code from https://github.com/fghxu/vial-qmk.git
- **Note**: this user repo was forked out from the official **vial-qmk repo** at (https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk)  on 2022/11/06   at:  SHA-1: 9c21e30b6c51b690b992d9616bc444ccd2ed5273
- Alternatively, you may also compile you id75 firmware using the the official **vial-qmk** repo: just copy over the below directory to the same location in **vial-qmk** repo. The rest of the steps described below should work.
- ```
  ....\vial-qmk\keyboards\ymdk\id75\
  ```
-
- Below steps are performed within the **MSYS**, and, suppose you will check out the **vial-qmk** repo at : d:/qmk/
  ``` sh
  cd /d/qmk
  git clone https://github.com/fghxu/vial-qmk.git
  cd /d/qmk/vial-qmk 
  make git-submodule
  ```
  
  Optional: (between compilations), delete the .build folder under /d/qmk/vial-qmk/  (just in case it caches the old definitions)
  
  To compile the firmware:
  ``` sh
  make ymdk/id75:vial
  ```
-
- You will have the firmware named "**ymdk_id75_vial.uf2**" created and placed under d:/qmk/vial-qmk/.
  Please follow the YMDK id75's instruction to reset the keyboard and copy the above **.uf2** file under the USB drive.   i.e.:
	- if you already have configured the QMK RESET key on your current keyboard, you don't need to open the keyboard to press the hardware reset key.  Just press the key to reset the keyboard to BootLoader mode.
	- otherwise, double push the hardware reset button in the back of the PCB.
	- there will be a USB drive appears in Windows/My Computer, drag the .uf2 to the USB drive. the USB key will auto ejected and keyboard is ready. You are all set.
	- open the **vial** configurator tool and start configure the keyboard in your own way.
-
- Good Luck!
